This is all the resources that I made using the Cognito workshop:
https://catalog.workshops.aws/wyld-pets-cognito/en-US/10-intro

The zip file is all the resources from the cloud 9 IDE that I built/copied.
The cloudformation template reflects some the cloud resources that I provisioned.
The template was created using the CF IaC Generator.
For some reason it only found api gateway resources during the scan...

Thus, the contents of this directory should, in theory, be sufficient to build the Cognito functionality described in the workshop and some of the AWS resources.
